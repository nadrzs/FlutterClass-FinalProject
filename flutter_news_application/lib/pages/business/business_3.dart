Workers with more than five years of tenure will get a 7% increase or earn 10% more than the market's start rate, whichever is higher. \n\nThe coffee chain implemented the wage hikes in May 2022 under the leadership of former CEO Howard Schultz, who waged an aggressive campaign against the union and faced backlash from the organization, politicians and customers for the strategy. Current CEO Laxman Narasimhan has been in the role for nearly a year. \n\nStarbucks also said Tuesday that it would provide unionized cafes with credit card tipping, a benefit that has been available in nonunion stores for more than a year. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/starbucks-and-workers-united-union-agree-to-framework-for-talks.html",
